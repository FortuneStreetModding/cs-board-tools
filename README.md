## Prerequisites
`cs-board-tools` requires Python 3.10 or higher.

## Installation
### For use in the CLI/Terminal
`cs-board-tools` can be installed via pip for use in the terminal:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/cs-board-tools
```
### For use in a Python project, as a library
...or it can be specified in your project's `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` file if you are building a project that will use `cs-board-tools` as a library.

`pyproject.toml`:
```toml
dependencies = [
  'cs-board-tools @ git+https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/cs-board-tools.git'
]
```

`requirements.txt`:
```bash
cs-board-tools @ git+https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/cs-board-tools@main
```

## Usage as a Library
### Loading a Board Bundle
In its simplest form, loading a board bundle is as easy as passing a filename into a Python function.
```py
from cs_board_tools.io import read_zip


def load_zip_bundle():
    filename="WiiU.zip"
    bundles = read_zip(filename)
    board_bundle = bundles[0]
```
### Validating a Board Bundle
Then, with that board_bundle object from the previous step, all you have to do is pass it into the `validate_board_bundle` function to validate it. What you will get in return is a **ValidationResultBundle** object, containing all of the results of the tests.

```py
results = validate_board_bundle(board_bundle)

percent = results.success_count / results.total_count
print(
    f"{results.success_count} out of {results.total_count} "
    f"({percent}%) tests were successful."
)
```

## Usage from the Terminal
`cs-board-tools` can be used from the terminal to display information about Fortune Avenue-compatible `.frb` files, Map Descriptor `.yaml` files, or Board Bundles either via `.zip` archive files, or by reading in files from a directory. It has two main commands: `display` and `validate`, and they work the same regardless of the type of input file you are passing in.

### Display from Directory
```bash
cs-board-tools display -d .
```

### Validate from File
```bash
cs-board-tools validate -f SomeAwesomeBundle.zip
```

These work vice-versa as well: you can validate bundles from directory, just as you can display bundles from file.

## Further Reading
`cs-board-tools` has a rich set of documentation, including detailed installation and usage instructions, and a full, traditional API reference. You can find the docs here: [ðŸ“š cs-board-tools documentation](https://fortunestreetmodding.github.io/cs-board-tools/).
