# Roadmap

Please take this page with a grain of salt. Forward-looking statements are always uncertain. But this page will reflect a best effort at prioritizing things that folks will actually want to use.

| Projected Date | Feature                                           | Additional Notes                                                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2023-12-31     | Update README.md files                            | These need updates, definitely required before shipping anything.     |
| 2023-12-31     | Queries libraries                                 | Pre-written functions to handle common queries.                       |
| 2023-12-31     | v0.1 release                                      | This is nearing completion.                                           |
| 2024-01-30     | Write support                                     | Allow saving changes to bundles.                                      |

| 2024-06-30     | Support for an input language.                    | This would allow a json document to describe all the desired changes. |

None yet, but some of these deadlines are coming up soon.

## How do I suggest an item for the roadmap?

The best way to do so is to raise an [Issue](https://github.com/fortunestreetmodding/cs-board-tools/issues) in the project's Github repository. This will make it visible to me, and others can comment on it and :thumbsup: your post.
